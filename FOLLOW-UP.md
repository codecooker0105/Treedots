---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
If I have more time I will show road line of shortest route from current location to selected hub.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I have used quasar-app-extension-q-google-map package to show google map.
There are other node packages but above package is comfortable and useful.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I've spent most of time to implement quasar-app-extension-q-google-map in quasar app.
That's why due to dependancy of package

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
I've implemented all requirements in ReadME.md and tested one by one.
I suggest to show loading icon before get current location from GPS.
